## Scenario #1 ##

**User wishes to view planets or stars**

**Initial assumption:** A user wishes to view a planet or star due to some inability to see them without a computer aide. There are preset loadable planets and stars the user can view or could possibly download new one off of the internet 

**Normal:** The user chooses to load a preset planet and is prompted by a list of already saved planets which would include planets like Earth, Mars, and Venus. Upon loading the planet the user would be able to view the planet or star in the viewer and could examine details about the planet or star. The user would also have the ability to hide the details about the planet or star so that they could get a better view of the planet or star. When the user is finished looking at the planet or star they would be able to exit to program.

**What can go wrong:** There could be a possible failure in loading a planet or star. In this case, the user would be informed of the failure and would be prompted to load another planet or star.

## Scenario #2 ##

**User wishes to edit a planet or star**

**Initial assumption:** A user wishes to edit an already existing planet or star to see what would happen if a planet or star was to change. The user would be able to see the differences in the planet or star as they changed attributes of the planet or star.

**Normal:** The user chooses to load up either a preset planet or star or previously saved planet or star. Upon loading the planet or star the user would be able to access a menu which contains the various attributes of the planet or star. The user would be able to manipulate these attributes and that could potentially change the planet or star, such as manipulating the atmosphere from the menu could change the viewable planet's or starâ€™s color. Upon finishing any potential edits, the user would have the ability to either save or save as, with save giving a warning as it would overwrite the planet or star.

**What can go wrong:** There could be a failure to either loading or saving the planet or star. In these cases, the user would be informed of the error.

**System state on completion:** When the user is done they would be able to close the program and at a later point open the program up and view the changes they have made.

## Scenario #3 ##

**User wishes to create a new planet or star**

**Initial assumption:** A user wishes to create a new planet or star from scratch to see a hypothetical planet or star that is not currently know about. The user would be given a default planet or star and would be able to manipulate it.

**Normal:** The user chooses to create a new planet or star, upon which it would load a default planet or star. Upon loading the user would be able to manipulate the attributes of the planet or star to see what effect they might have. When the user is finished they would be able to save the planet or star so that they might view again at a later date.

**What can go wrong:** There could be a failure saving a planet or star. In this case, the user would be informed of the error.


**System state on completion:** When the user is done they would be able to close the program and at a later point open the program up and view the changes they have made
