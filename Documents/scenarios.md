## Scenario #1 ##

**User wishes to view planets**

**Initial assumption:** A user wishes to view a planet or star due to some inability to see them without a computer aide. There are preset loadable planets and stars the user can view or could possibly download new one off of the internet 

**Normal:** The user chooses to load a preset planet and is prompted by a list of already saved planets which would include planets like Earth, Mars, and Venus. Upon loading the planet the user would be able to view the planet or star in the viewer and could examine details about the planet or star. The user would also have the ability to hide the details about the planet or star so that they could get a better view of the planet or star. When the user is finished looking at the planet or star they would be able to exit to program.

**What can go wrong:** There could be a possible failure in loading a planet. In this case, the user would be informed of the failure and would be prompted to load another planet or star.
